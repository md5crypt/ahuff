Starting in the contest for the most useless code written in my life:
Adaptive Huffman encoding! Using the Vitter algorithm! Written in Node.js!
It's like forcing a already open door with a sponge!
But it works, and in O(logn) time!

Usage:
	node ahuff.js <file> for compression
	node ahuff.js x <file> for decompression
